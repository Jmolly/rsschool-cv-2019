#### Summary
My personal goal is to get better at what I do everyday of my life.  
Resently i found out that i like front-end developing, so I took some online courses (codecademy and htmlacademy).  
Started Duolingo courses. And finally I came to RSSchool.  
For now I want to finish these courses and come work to EPAM. And I will.
