#### Summary
My personal goal is to get better at what I do everyday of my life.  
Resently i found out that i like front-end developing, so I took some online courses (codecademy and htmlacademy).  
Started Duolingo courses. And finally I came to RSSchool.  
For now I want to finish these courses and come work to EPAM. And I will.  
The opportunity to work for such big company is very exiting and that is what drives me ahead.  
Also it is so nice that all these wonderful people, this community tries to help people like me found their place and make people happy by doing it.
